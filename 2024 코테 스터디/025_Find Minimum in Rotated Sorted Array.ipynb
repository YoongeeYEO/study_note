It has now been rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6] might become:\n","\n","  - [3,4,5,6,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.\n","  - [1,2,3,4,5,6] if it was rotated 6 times.\n","- Notice that rotating the array 4 times moves the last four elements of the array to the beginning. Rotating the array 6 times produces the original array.\n","\n","- Assuming all elements in the rotated sorted array nums are unique, return the minimum element of this array.\n","\n","- A solution that runs in O(n) time is trivial, can you write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time?\n","\n","Constraints:\n","- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000\n","- -1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n"],"metadata":{"id":"WXiW8Gcp7lbz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Solution\n","- min[] 활용하여 간단하게 해결!"],"metadata":{"id":"J0cl_IcONHGo"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from typing import List\n","\n","class Solution:\n","    def findMin(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:\n","        return min(nums)"],"metadata":{"id":"CHN6t0WMrxdL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732527748939,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":307,"user":{"displayName":"YOONGEE","userId":"13265385226373116446"}}},"execution_count":1,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["nums = [4,5,0,1,2,3]\n","\n","solution = Solution()\n","solution.findMin(nums)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"caUNoFuns3Rj","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732527814860,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":317,"user":{"displayName":"YOONGEE","userId":"13265385226373116446"}},"outputId":"81e1d4cc-8594-48bf-c3bd-8490e9f12ae1"},"execution_count":2,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":2}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["nums = [4,5,6,7]\n","\n","solution.findMin(nums)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ha8h1CWztHXJ","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1732527833943,"user_tz":-540,"elapsed":275,"user":{"displayName":"YOONGEE","userId":"13265385226373116446"}},"outputId":"460c3358-fb32-4df4-fcf0-4a7025af4d95"},"execution_count":3,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["4"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":3}]}]}
